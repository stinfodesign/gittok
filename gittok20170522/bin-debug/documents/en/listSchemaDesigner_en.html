<p class="mainSentence">Conventional maps are diagrams of symbols distributed on the sheet. One of the purpose of GISs is to represent  valuable maps. In gittok, two dimensional maps can be represented if proxies of features are geometric attributes. However, as long as feature is an abstruction of real world phenomena, a feature does not always have geometry as its attribute.  <br />
Imagine you are working at the global company. If someone ask where your companyis. May be you will answer &quot;The head office is located in Tokyo, Japan. However there are many branches in all over the world. I am working at the office in New York.&quot; How about the shape of this company? But the company is a sharing concept or aggreeement among the related people. Asking the shape of the company could be non-sense. A geographic feature without geometric attributeIt is sometimes natural. If a proxy attribite is a character string such as a name of a company, a list of company names can be seen as an one dimensional mapinstead of a two dimensinal geometric map. In gittok, one dimensional nominal map is called a list.</p>
