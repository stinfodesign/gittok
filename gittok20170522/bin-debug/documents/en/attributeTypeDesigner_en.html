<p class="FirstHeader">Attribute Type Designer</p>
<p class="secondHeader">Introduction</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Attribute types included in a feature type or an association type are defined in Attribute Type Designer. Most features and associations have attributes. For example, the feature type &quot;Earthquake&quot; may have &quot;seismic center&quot; and &quot;intensity&quot; as attributes. the data type of seismic center could be SG_Point and the data type of intensity cold be Real. </p>
<p class="mainSentence">In case of gittok, there are 4 types of attributes. They are thematic data type, spatial data type, place data type, and temporal data type. However, the implementation of temporal data types in gittok is a future issue.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">Thematic data types</p>
<p class="mainSentence">The symbolic expression of geometric feature on a map is changed in accordance with the value of the indicator to show the theme of a map. Such indicator is called thematic attribute as it is an inherent characteristic of the feature to show the theme. For example, when we make a population density distribution map, the variation of colors are decided to show degrees of density, and they are used to fill administrative districts in the target area. In this case a variation of colors is the range of attribute values. Such an attribute is an important data for the thematic map, and it has been called ’thematic’ attribute. However today,  attributes having one value is called a thematic attribute. And the data type of the thematic attribute is called a thematic data type.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Integer, Real , Bool, CharacterString  are simple data typeshaving one value. Memo is a complex data type having title and value. These five data types are called thematic data types. ArrayList of simple data  is also a data type of a thematic attribute if multiplicity is required. Implementation of a value of each data type depends on the programming language. Gittok is implemented by Adobe Flash Builder. Thus implementation is done in accordance wth the rules of Actionscribpt 3.0. Memo is a special data type defined in gittok. It is a sequence of more than one paragraphs.The GUI for editng memo (momo editor) is provided in gittok. Meanwhile, CharacterString is assumed as a short phase without line break. Add and delete of a character string is done in the Editor page.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">If a data type is Integer or Real, users may put unit of measure such as m, km, and m2. However gittok does not check the validity of the unit. </p>

<p class="mainSentence">Figure 1. Schema for thematic data types</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Getter and setter are provided in every thematic data types. They are accessor functions and they are useful to encapsulate valiables inside of classes. Such a method cannot be said as the best. However, gittok uses this mechanism, because the data type of v is Any, but we want to input and output values in accordance with the primitive data type such as Integer, Real, Bool or Chatacter string. 'Number' is a data type for any numbers used in Actionscript.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">Spatial data type</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Spatial attribute represents a spatial characteristic of a feature. In gittok, it is represented by 2-dimensional geometry, SG_Point, SG_Curve and SG_Surface. They topologically relates with others. SG_Point is a boundary of SG_Curve. A sequence of SG_Curve with direction (SG_Ring) is a boundary of SG_Surface. A coordinate is not spatial attribute, but a part of the spatial attribute. SG_Point includes position and its data type is coordinate. SG_Curve has a sequence of coordinates to represent a shape of a curve. In gittok, 3-dimensional primitive such as Solid is not defined. </p>

<p class="mainSentence">Figure 1. Spatial schema</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Spatial attribute is one of the most important attributes for geographic features. There is a possibility that a feature has more than one type of spatial attributes. While, there is a possibility that a feature does not have a spatial attribute. Imagine the concept of &quot;University&quot;.<br />
  University associates with its campus and buildings in its area. It means &quot;Campus&quot; may have its area and buildings as its attributes. They are spatial attributes. However &quot;University&quot; itself does not have a spatial attribute, because it is a virtual feature. The existence of the university is assured by  an agreement between government and people related in the university. </p>
<p class="secondHeader">Place data types</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Place attribute indirectly represents a position of a feature. There are two types of places. One is a place indicating the position in the real world. The other is a place in the information space such as a place in Internet. A place in the real world is called &quot;geographic identifier&quot;. A place in Internet is represented as &quot;Uniforml Resource Locator (URL)&quot;. URL is an identifier to show the storing location of the resource as an attribute of a feature. Gittok uses Address as geographic identifier.  URL, ImageURL, SoundURL, and VideoURL are place in the information space. Gittok allows f4v format for the video data, and mp3 for sound as resources. </p>
