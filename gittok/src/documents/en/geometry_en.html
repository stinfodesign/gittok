<p class="FirstHeader">Geometry</p>
<p class="mainSentence">This page enables acquisition of geometric attributes and association data between different features under the cooperation with Editor page. What is geometric attribute, how to use Geometry and  Association page will be explained here. Please refer Editor page because,association between features are mainly explained in Editor page. </p>
<p class="secondHeader">Geometric attributes</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Geometric attributes describe spatial characteristics of features. Many of features abstracted from things on Earth have geometric characteristics such as point, curve and surface. For example, trees can be represented by points. Seashore and boundary of vegetation area can be represented by curves. And inside of such boundaries are extents of features called surface.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">There are two types of dimensions. One is geometric dimension. The other is topological dimension. Coordinates consisting in geometries consists of one, two or three coordinate elements. Such a number is geometric dimension. While, curves possible to map onto a straight line is one dimansional topologically. Surface that is possible to map onto a plane is two dimansional. Such dimensions are topological dimensions. Features created in gittok may have up to two dimensional geometries and their complex. Geometric primitive (point , curve or surface) is an open simplex. &quot;Open&quot; means that each geometric primitive does not contain its boundary. Each primitive associates with other primitives as boundary or co-boundary.  Point is a boundary of curves. Curve is a boundary of surfaces. Surface is a co-boundary of curves. Curve is a co-boundary of points. Geometric primitives and their associations are defined as gittok spatial schema referring ISO 19107 - Spatial schema.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">Spatial schema</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Spatial schema consists of geometric primitive, geometric complex and auxiliary geometric objects. Figure 1 shows the overview of the gittok spatial schema.</p>

<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Preparation of geometric data acquisition</span><br />
  </p>
<p class="mainSentence">Geometric data are acquired by map digitizing in gittok. A map used for acquisition is called a base map. Its map projection should be plane rectangular or UTM. <br />
  First of all, a folder in PC should be prepared. A structure of the folder is as follows. The name of the folder can be decided by yourself.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><img src="../figures/kitFolderSructure_en.png" width="243" height="311" alt="kitFolder" /></p>

Plane rectangular coordinates of control points can be obtained by using the web-site for coordinate conversion for example in Japan.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">The procedure of base map orientation is as follows.<br />
  1. Key-in an id of the control point at the field of control point id.<br />
  2. Move the target control point on the map to the center of the panel by using buttons and slider put at the title bar on the panel. The functions of buttons and slider are as follows.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">fix / pan: Translation of the map is possible by clicking &quot;fix&quot; button (&quot;fixf&quot; is replaced by &quot;pan&quot;). translation is possible during the button is &quot;pan&quot;, but position digitizing is impossible.<br />

<p class="mainSentence">1. Search the target geometry.<br />
  2. click &quot;delete&quot; button.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Connection between geometry and feature instance</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Geometry may be an attribute of a feature instance. A feature becomes an owner of geometry by holding the id of geometry. A geometry becomes an attribute of a feature by holding an id and attribute name of the feature. Geometry may not be an attribute of feature. For example, a sequence of curves may be an attribute of a road. However, edge points of curves may not be an attribute. Rings and orientable curves can not be attributes of features, because they are parts of surfaces.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">The procedure to define points, curves and surfaces as attributes of features is as follows. </p>
<p class="mainSentence">1.Search the geometry which will be an attribute. If it is already an attribute of a feature, the id of the feature appears in Instance ID drop down list on Editor page. Such a geometry cannot be an attribute of another feature.<br />
2. Create new feature instance by clicking &quot;add&quot; button on Editor page.<br />
3. Select the row of the attribute listed in AttributeType List.<br />
4. Click &quot;add&quot; button at the right lower of Editor page. The id of geometry appears after &quot;add&quot; button is clicked.<br />
