<p class="secondHeader">Introduction</p>
<p class="mainSentence">An action to provide information by processing given data is called representation. Documentation, Voice encoding, Tabulation, and drawing graphs are representation. And mapping is a typical representation go geospatial information. Cartography is a technology for map production. </p>
<p><span class="secondHeader">Map Design</span></p>
<p class="mainSentence">Cartographer should consider that map users imagine, predict,  determine and act by watching past, now and future drawn on the map. The value of map is evaluated not only the quality of data source but also the quality of design. According to Judith A. Tyner [Principles of Map Design, The Guilford Press, 2010, pp.18-23], any design, whether of maps or buildings, has certain goals: clarity, order, balance, contrast, unity, and harmony.
</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Clarity</span><br />
  Clarity involves examining the objectives of the map, emphasizing the important points, and eliminating anything that does not enhance the map message.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Order</span><br />
  Since the map is a synoptic, not a serial, communication, cartographers cannot assume that readers will look first at the title, then at the legend, and so on. However, studies of eye movements show there is considerable shifting of view. For example, vertical lines lead the eye up and down on the map; horizontal lines lead the eye left and right. </p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Balance</span><br />
  Every element of the map has visual weight. These weights should be distributed evenly about the optical center of the page, which is a point slightly above the actual center. Generally, visual weight within a frame depends on location, size, color, shape, and direction. According to Rudolf Arnheim [Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye,  University of California Press, 1969, pp.14-15] .</p>
<p class="mainSentence">- Centrally located elements have less weight than those to one side.<br />
  - Objects in the upper half appear heavier than those in the lower half.<br />
  - Objects on the right side appear heavier than those on the left side.<br />
  - Weight appears to increase with increasing distance from the center.<br />
  - Isolated elements have more weight than grouped objects.<br />
  - Larger elements have greater visual weight.<br />
  - Red is heavier than blue.<br />
  - Bright colors are heavier than dark.<br />
  - Regular shapes seem heavier than irregular shape.<br />
  - Compact shapes have more visual weight than unordered, diffuse shapes.<br />
  - Forms with a vertical orientation seem heavier than oblique forms.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Contrast</span><br />
  Contrast is the difference between light and dark, thick and thin and light. A map created with only one line weight, one font size, and one font lacks construct, is boring to look at, and is hard to read.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Unity</span><br />
  Unity refers to the interrelationships between map elements. Lettering is not chosen in isolation; it must be legible over any background colors and shades, must not conflict with chosen symbols, and must suit the topic of the map.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Harmony</span><br />
  All of the elements (for example, color, pattern and font) on the map should work together. Overall map should have a pleasing appearance.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Cartographer page enables design of symbols and labels. And you can design portrayal dictionary for your own purpose by allocation of symbols and labels for representation of each feature and annotation.</p>
