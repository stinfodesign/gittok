<p class="FirstHeader">Operation Embedding</p>
<p class="mainSentence">You can embed you own operations in gittok under GPL license version 3. This text explains How gittok execute operations and how you can embed you operation. However knowledge of Adobe Flush builder and Actionscribpt 3.0 are required to read this text.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">Execution procedure of operations</p>
<p class="mainSentence">The processing procedure of the function executeButton_clickHandler in Analyst.mxml is introduced. You should read the explanation to keep  the program of executeButton_clickHander at your side. You can get the program through Github.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">1. Operation type is selected from &quot;operationList&quot; at first. &quot;OperationList&quot; is a list of operation types defined in feature types and operation types included in an application schema. Operation type shall be selected at Analyst before executeButton is clicked.<br />
  2. Class name in which the operation is declared is defined as '&quot;geoOperations.&quot; + operationType.type'. &quot;geoOperations&quot; is a folder which keeps geographic operation classes.<br />
  3. &quot;classRef&quot; is obtained by applying the function &quot;getDefinitionByName&quot;. &quot;classRef&quot; is an object identifying the operation with operation’s name as a keyword.<br />
  4. &quot;argObj&quot; is constructed. &quot;argObj&quot; is an object to keep arguments for the operation.<br />
  4.1. Argument dictionary &quot;argObj&quot; is an array of objects taking argument type as its key. ArgObj is constructed by selecting attributes as arguments from the feature instance if the operation is defined in a feature.<br />
  4.2. ArgObj is constructed by selecting attributes as arguments from &quot;from&quot; and/or &quot;to&quot; features and/or association instance if the operation is defined in an association.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">The structure of argObj is as follows.<br />
  key: the name of argument<br />
  value: an array list (ArrayList) of attribute values<br />
  attribute value: a value of any data type</p>
<p class="mainSentence">An attribute value may be an array list, if multiplicity of an attribute is true. An array list of attribute values is also possible, if multiplex of to-feature is true. Therefore, gittok makes an argument as array list of array list.<br />
  4.3. Affine parameters are included in argObj, because if the return value has an unit of measure. In such a case the return value should be measured on the ground and conversion from map to ground is required. The keyword for the type of return value is &quot;affineParam&quot;.<br />
  5. The operation is executed by giving an operation name (opName) and argObj. The return value is stored in valueObject.<br />
  6. Analyze and store the return value in appropriate position.<br />
  6.1. If the operation is feature operation and it is an attribute of the feature itself, the return value is stored in the derived attribute.<br />
  6.2. If the operation is feature operation and it is an attribute of the to-feature, the return value is stored in the derived attribute of from- or to-feature.<br />
  6.3. If the operation is association operation and it is an attribute of the from-feature, the return value is stored in the derived attribute of the from-feature.<br />
  6.4. If the operation is association operation and it is an attribute of the to-feature, the return value is stored in the derived attribute of the to-feature.<br />
  6.5. If the operation is association operation and it is an attribute of the association itself, the return value is stored in the derived attribute of the association.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">Operation embedding </p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Operation</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Operation enables to get unknown attribute value by applying a function defined in gittok. New operation can be embedded in gittok by the user of gittok as it is free and open source software under GPL license version 3. Operation is a function included in the operation class. For example an operation class to get center include functions for gravity centers of a set of points, a curve, a surface, a complex, maximal inscribed circle of a surface, and so on.<br />
</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Operation class</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Operation class is defined as a class in geoOperation package. For example, Center class is defined as follows.</p>
<pre>package geoOperations<br/>
{
	import dataTypes.spatialGeometry.*;
	import mx.collections.ArrayList;<br />
	public class Center
	{
		…………………

	}
}


<span class="thirdHeader">Operation declaration</span></pre>
<p class="mainSentence">Execution of an operation is possible without creation of instance as it is defined as a static function. For example the operation to get gravity center of a set of points is represented as follows. </p>
<pre>package geoOperations
{
		import dataTypes.spatialGeometry.*;
  	import mx.collections.ArrayList;<br />
		public class Center
  	{<br />
		…………………………………<br />
			public static function centerOfPoints(argObj:Object):SG_Point {
				var points:ArrayList = new ArrayList();
				var pointValues:ArrayList = argObj[&quot;points&quot;] as ArrayList;
				
				points.addAll(pointValues.getItemAt(0) as ArrayList);
<br />				var wp:SG_Point = new SG_Point();
<br />				var m:int = points.length;
				if (m == 0) return null;
<br />				var x:Number = 0;
				var y:Number = 0;
				var coord:Coordinate2;<br/>
				for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; m; i++) {
					wp = points.getItemAt(i) as SG_Point;
					coord = wp.position;
					x += coord.x;
					y += coord.y;
				}
<br />
				var p:SG_Point = new SG_Point();
				p.featureID = wp.featureID;
				p.attributeName = wp.attributeName;
<br />				p.position.x = x/m;
				p.position.y = y/m;
<br />
				return p;
			}
 		 	…………………………………
		}
}

</pre>
<p class="thirdHeader">Coordinate conversion</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Coordinate conversion from the map to the ground is required before the execution of the operation if the return value has an unit of measure. For example length and area have unit of measures such as meter and square meter on the ground. To convert coordinates, affine parameters are required as follows.</p>
<pre>public class SurfaceArea
{
    public static function getArea(argObj:Object):Real {
 		var ap:AffineParam = argObj[&quot;affineParam&quot;] as AffineParam;<br />
  		var attValues:ArrayList = argObj[&quot;surface&quot;] as ArrayList;
  		var attValue:ArrayList = attValues.getItemAt(0) as ArrayList;
  		var srf:SG_Surface = attValue.getItemAt(0) as SG_Surface;
  		var area:Number;
  		var ring:SG_Ring = srf.exterior;
  		var closedLS:CoordinateArray = ring.coordinateSequence();<br />
			// coordinate conversion from map to ground
  		var n:int = closedLS.length;
  		for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
  			var coor:Coordinate2 = closedLS.getItemAt(i) as Coordinate2;
  			coor = math.Affine.conversion(coor, ap.coefficient);
  			closedLS.setItemAt(coor, i);
  		}

	    area = math.Area.getSimpleArea(closedLS);
  		n = srf.interior.length;
  		for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
  			ring = srf.interior.getItemAt(i) as SG_Ring;
  			closedLS = ring.coordinateSequence();
  			area += math.Area.getSimpleArea(closedLS);
  		}
 		 if (area &lt; 0) area = -area;<br />
 		 var ans:Real = new Real();
  		ans.value = area;
  		return ans;
		}
   }
}
</pre>
<p class="thirdHeader">Arguments</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Arguments are input parameters for the operation and they are selected from a feature, an association and &quot;from&quot; and/or &quot;to&quot; features of an association. An argument is described by an array list even the number of parameter is single. Therefore, the operation has to bring out an array list and get an argument value as a first element of the array list.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">The example shown below describes the operation to get shortest distance from one point to a set of points.</p>
<pre>public static function distancePtoP(argObj:Object):ArrayList {<br />	var ap:AffineParam = argObj[&quot;affineParam&quot;] as AffineParam;<br />			<br />	var fromAttValues:ArrayList = argObj[&quot;fromPoint&quot;] as ArrayList;<br />	var toAttValues:ArrayList   = argObj[&quot;toPoint&quot;] as ArrayList;<br />			<br />	var dists:ArrayList = new ArrayList();<br />			<br />	for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; fromAttValues.length; i++) {<br />		var nearest:Number = Number.MAX_VALUE;<br />		var attValue:ArrayList = fromAttValues.getItemAt(i) as ArrayList;<br />		var fromPoint:SG_Point = attValue.getItemAt(0) as SG_Point;<br />			<br />		var fcr:Coordinate2 = math.Affine.conversion(fromPoint.position, ap.coefficient);<br />			<br />		for (var j:int = 0; j &lt; toAttValues.length; j++) {<br />			attValue = toAttValues.getItemAt(j) as ArrayList;<br />			var toPoint:SG_Point = attValue.getItemAt(0) as SG_Point;<br />			<br />			var tcr:Coordinate2 = math.Affine.conversion(toPoint.position, ap.coefficient);<br />			<br />			var d:Number = math.Distance.p2p(fcr, tcr);<br />			nearest = (nearest &gt; d) ? d: nearest;<br />		}<br />		var distance:Real = new Real();<br />		distance.value = nearest;<br />		dists.addItem(distance);<br />	}<br />	return dists;<br />}</pre>
<p class="mainSentence">The data type of argObj is Object and it is an array of arguments in consideration of the number of element in each argument is more than one. The table shown below indicates the elements of argument 1 is more than one and the element of argument 2 is only one.</p>

<p class="thirdHeader">Data type of return value</p>
<p class="mainSentence">The data type of the return value is declared at the definition of feature or association type in an application schema. The type in the example above is Real.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">Procedure of embedding</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Two actions are required when the new operation class is embedded in geoOperation package. One is the registration of parameters (class name, operation name, argument types and return value type) defining the operation. The other is the import of the class in Analyst.mxml.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">operation.xml</p>
<p class="mainSentence">When operation class and operation are embedded, necessary information to declare their position, arguments and return value type in operation.xml storing  under &quot;gittok &gt; src &gt; texts&quot; shall be inserted. The structure of operation.xml is as follows.</p>
<pre>&lt;opDef name=&quot;GeoOperations&quot;&gt;<br />		&lt;opClass className=&quot;CenterOfGravity&quot;&gt;
  		&lt;operation opeName=&quot;centerOfPoints&quot; returnType=&quot;SG_Point&quot;&gt;<br />				&lt;argument argName=&quot;points&quot; dataType=&quot;SG_Point&quot; multiplicity=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;<br />  		&lt;/operation&gt;<br />	
  			… (More than one operation elements would be declared) …<br />
  	&lt;/opClass&gt;
&lt;/opDef&gt;</pre>
<p class="mainSentence">&lt;opDef name=&quot;GeoOperations&quot;&gt; is a root tag of the xml document.<br />
  &lt;opClass className=&quot;…&quot;&gt; is a class of more than one operation. <br />
  &lt;operation opName=&quot;…&quot; returnType=&quot;…&quot;&gt; is an element for operation and it has operation name and return value type as its attributes.<br />
  &lt;argument argName=&quot;…&quot; dataType=&quot;…&quot; multiplicity=&quot;…&quot;&gt; is an element to declare each argument. It has the name of argument, argument data type, and multiplicity (true or false).<br />
The user who want to embed new operation has to insert opClass and/or operation elements in operation.xml.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Declaration to import new operation class</p>
<p class="mainSentence">New operation class shall be imported in Analyst.mxml after the insert of operation class in geoOperation folder. Import is done at the position shown below.</p>
