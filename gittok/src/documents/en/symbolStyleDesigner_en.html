<p class="mainSentence">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Map symbol is a graphic representation of a feature on a map. A symbol is designed in accordance with a symbol style, and it is classified into point, line and area. A symbol style is a rule to specify graphic attributes of a symbol, and to indicate association with other symbols, which are parts of the symbol. The symbol style schema defines the types of symbol styles. This page explains what is the Symbol Style Schema, how to create symbols on a map according to the symbol schema, and how to use Symbol Style Designer. </p>

<p class="thirdHeader">CLASS</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="mainSentence"><strong>SymbolStyleDictionary</strong></span><br />
  Symbol style dictionary is a class to represent  collections of point, line and area symbol styles. It has a name of the dictionary (name) as its attribute, and association to pointSymStyles, lineSymStyles, and areaSymStyles. an instance of this type is the symbol style dictionary.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"> <span class="mainSentence"><strong>SymbolStyle</strong></span><br />
This class is the root class of symbol styles. This abstract class has a name as its attribute. This class is associated by pointSymbolStyle. It means that a pointSymbolStyle has other symbol style classes as parts.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="mainSentence"><strong>LineSymbolStyle</strong></span><br />
This class defines attributes of a line. They are color, thickness, transparency (alpha), edge shape (caps), vertex shape (joints), solid part length of a dashed line (dash), interval part length of a dashed line (gap). Dash and gap are optional.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="mainSentence"><strong>AreaSymbolStyle</strong></span><br />
This class defines attributes of an area. They are filling color (color) and transparency (alpha), The boundar style is defined by a line symbol style.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="mainSentence"><strong>PointSymbolStyle</strong></span><br />
This class defines a style of a point symbol by coordinate arrays (elements) corresponding with line and area symbol styles. A coordinate array corresponding to an area symbol style shall be closed. Its interior is filled by the area symbol style. According to the Figure 1, point symbol style may have associations with other symbol styles. Actually, associations with line and area symbol styles are possible. However, it is impossible to associate with other point symbol style now. </p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="mainSentence"><strong>CircleSymbolStyle</strong></span><br />
This class defines a circle as a sub-class of AreaSymbolStyle. There is no special attribute, but a style of coordinate array is different from area symbols. This is explained in detail at the next section (Symbol Schema).</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">ROLL NAME</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>pointSymbolStyles</strong><br />
A collection of point symbol styles.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>lineSymbolStyles</strong><br />
A collection of line symbol styles.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>areaSymbolStyles</strong><br />

<p class="mainSentence"><strong>borderStyle</strong><br />
a line symbol style representing a border of the area.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>styles</strong><br /> 
  Symbol styles used by the point symbol style. 
Point symbol style may have associations with other symbol styles. Actually, associations with line and area symbol styles are possible. However, it is impossible to associate with other point symbol style now. </p>
<p class="mainSentence"></p>
<p class="secondHeader">Symbol creation</p>
<p class="mainSentence">A symbol is created  from a geometric attribute of a feature in a kit in compliance with the corresponding symbol style. For example, in case a geometric attribute is a point, the symbol is created according to the point symbol style at a position of the point. The symbol is instantiated in compliance with the symbol schema. </p>
<p class="mainSentence">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="secondHeader">Symbol schema</p>
<p class="mainSentence">The symbol schema specifies rules for map drawing by symbols in accordance with the symbol styles. Relationship between symbol style schema and symbol schema is similar to the relationship between GFM and Instance Model. Symbol Style Schema is a meta-model and Synbol Schema is a model of symbol instances.</p>

<p class="thirdHeader">CLASS</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="mainSentence"><strong>Sprite</strong></span><br />
This class is provided by ActionScript V3 used for the coding of gittok. It may have more than one child graphic objects and its graphic instance can be searched by a mouse on the screen. There are explanations on a web-site of Adobe and related text books. All symbols defined in gittok are defined as sub-classes of Sprite.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="mainSentence"><strong>LineSymbol</strong></span><br />
This class defines a line symbol. It has a coordinate array that is modified by a line symbol style. Gittok portrays a line symbol as a sprite on the screen using these data.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="mainSentence"><strong>AreaSymbol</strong></span><br />
This class defines an area symbol, which has a closed coordinate array and a style for graphic representation. Gittok portrays an area symbol as a sprite on the screen using these data.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="mainSentence"><strong>PointSymbol</strong></span><br />
This class defines a point symbol, which has a coordinate of a point and a style for graphic representation. Gittok portrays a point symbol as a sprite on the screen using these data.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="mainSentence"><strong>Circle</strong></span><br />
This class defines a circle by a center coordinate, a radius of a circle, and a style for graphic representation. A point position is used as a center position on the screen. The radius is calculated bythe first coordinate and the next coordinate in the coordinate array stored in the point symbol style. It means a circle is used as a point modifier.</p>
