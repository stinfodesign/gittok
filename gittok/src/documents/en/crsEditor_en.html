<p class="mainSentence">CRS is an abbreviation of Coordinate Reference System. CRS is defined as &quot;coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum&quot; in ISO 19111:2007 - Spatial referencing by Coordinates. Datum in this case is a geodetic datum that is defined by a set of parameters to describe the shape of the earth and the prime meridian as a starting meridian to measure longitude.This text introduces CRS and then explains CRS Editor page.</p>

<p class="mainSentence">The structure of gittok CRS is defined by the following UML diagram. </p>

  </p>
<p class="mainSentence">GeodeticDatum defines a shape of Earth as an ellipsoid, and where is the prime meridian for this datum. Datum is a singular form of data. But geodetic datum consists of multi parameters. A line specifying longitude is a curve called meridian which connects north pole and south pole. The meridian referring zero degree is called prime meridian that is a curve usually passing Greenwich in England and the east direction is plus. However it is possible to set prime meridian at any longitude. Such longitude can be defined in the geodetic datum as &quot;greenwich longitude&quot;.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Attributes</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>id</strong><br />
  identification code of the geodetic datum. A rule to put id should be specified at the authoritative organization such as International Association of Oil &amp; Gas Products (http://www.epsg-registry.org). An id of Japanese Deodetic Datum today is &quot;JGD2011&quot;.</p>

<p class="mainSentence"><span class="secondHeader">Ellipsoid</span><br />
  </p>
<p class="mainSentence">This class has a set of parameters defining the shape of Earth as a reference ellipsoid. The shape of Earth can be approximated by the spheroid and it is called a reference ellipsoid. Parameters of Ellipsoid are semi-major axis (semiMajorAxis) and inverse flattening (inverseFlattening). Inverse flattening is frequently used in Geodetical computations. It can is defined as, a/ (a - b). Where &quot;a&quot; is a length of semi-major axis, and &quot;b&quot; is a length of semi-minor axis. </p>
<p class="mainSentence">Japanese government adopted &quot;Japanese Geodetic datum 2011&quot; and which parameters are,<br />
  semiMajorAxis = 6377397.155 m<br />
  inverseFlattening = 298.257222101</p>
<p class="mainSentence">This ellipsoid is originally provided as GRS80 by International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in 1980.  Meanwhile in October 2011, GSI released &quot;Japanese Geodetic Datum 2011 (JGD2011)&quot; as the new standard datum of Japan because of the wide area crustal deformation caused by &quot;The 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake&quot; which occurred on March 11, 2011.  Parameters of Ellipsoid did not change but the local origin point of latitude and longitude, and the reference position of height changed. These parameters are used for the determination of control points, but they are not required for map projections.</p>
