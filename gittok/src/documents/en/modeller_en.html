<p class="secondHeader">Introduction</p>
<p class="mainSentence">This page enables the users to desgin application schemata. Application schema is a formal description of the model that conceptualize real world phenomena included in the universe of discourse defined as the scope of your research or mission. Figure 1 is an example of a simple application schema. It expresses that &quot;Buildingr&quot; has its name, ower's name, shape as attributes, and it is possible to get the area of the buikding by getArea operartion.</p>

<p class="mainSentence"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> An example of simple application schema written by UML</p>
<p class="mainSentence"> Gittok uses a conceptual schema language called UML (Unified Modeling Language) for the formal models. Usually &quot;language&quot; is used for the text description. In case of UML, diagram is used to make communication with others.<br />
  UML is widely used to develop information systems today as the schema language for the object oriented modeling. We also describe the rules how to define application schema. In other words, we use UML to describe application schemata.<br />
  You should study  how to describe &quot;class diagram&quot; such as the diagram in Modeler page. You will see many UML class diagrams in gittok. These diagrams are written using the free UML Editor called ArgoUML. You can easily design your schema with this free software.However it is rather old, because  the version of UML supported by ArgoUML is 1.4 and the latest version is Version 2. However the rules for class diagram is almost the same. Off course, you can use other UML tools. And you can get and read UML text books and many tips on the web.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">General Feature Model</p>
<p class="mainSentence">An abstraction of real world phenomena is called a feature. For example, natural phenomena such as typhoon and tsunami, artificial structures such as building and road, and imaginal objects such as national border and land use regulation are all  features.  Feature can be viewed from two different aspects. One is a type (or class), the other is an instance. For example, the proposition &quot;That is a bridge&quot; declares the thing as its type. While, &quot;That is Rainbow Bridge&quot; describes a thing as an individual, in other words, an instance of the type. General Feature Model (GFM) is a set of rules to describe feature types and their relationships. The rules <span class="mainSentence">how to describe instances are explained at Editor page.</span></p>
<p class="mainSentence">UML does not specify rules for features or real world phenomena, because it is a general purpose language. GFM specifies a rules to describe class diagrams for features and their relationships called application schema under UML rules. GFM is a model of the description for application schemata. UML is a model of GFM. Thus, UML is a meta-model of application schemata.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><img src="../figures/GeneralFeatureModel.png" width="690" height="559" alt="GFM" /></p>
<p class="mainSentence">Figure 2. Structure of GFM used in gittok represented by UML </p>
<p class="secondHeader">ApplicationSchema</p>
<p class="mainSentence">The class called ApplicationSchema in Figure 2 shows the rules for description of application schemas. It means that the instance class of the meta-class ApplicationSchema is an application schema. An application schema consists of more than one feature classes and more than zero relationships between feature classes.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Geographic Information System (GIS) conventionally uses analysis operations applying attributes of features to get knowledge to solve the problems. Operations and attributes are properties of a feature. We think feature with attributes and operations is the fundamental element to recognize phenomena in the world. For example, Aristotle explained the recognition of phenomena as follows.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Phenomena in the real world can be recognized as individual or concept. An individual is a subject of a proposition (idea, estimation, …)  and a concept is a predicate. For example, Socrates is a subject and human being is a predicate in the proposition &quot;Socrates is a human being.&quot; Aristotle called indivisual and predicate by the terms &quot;primary substance&quot; and &quot;secoundary substance&quot;. While a predicate is not only scondary substance but also quantity or qualification or a relative or where or when or being in a position or having or doing or being affected. To give a rough idea, ideas of substance are man, horse; of quantity: four foot, five foot; of qualification; white, grammatical; of a relative: double, half, larger; of where: in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of when: yesterday, last year; of being in a position: is-lying, is-sitting; of having: has-shoes-on, has-armour-on; of doing: cutting, burning; of being-affected: being-cut, being-burnt. (Aritotle, Categories, 1b25 - 2a4).</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Both doing and being affected are operations. Having is association between other objects. quantity, qualification,being in a position, when and where are attributes. Secondary substance is a parent concept. The relationship between primary substance and secondary substance is an inheritance. Consequently, it can be said that Aristotle's theory is the underlying concepts of GFM.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Attributes</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>name</strong><br />
A name of application schema.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Associations</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>featureTypes</strong><br />
An applicaion schema may have more than one feature types.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>associationTypes</strong><br />
An application schema may have more than zero association types.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">FeatureType</p>
<p class="mainSentence">FeatureType class represents rules to describe feature type as instance of FeatureType. The name of a feature type shall be unique in an application schema. The first letter of the name of feature type shall be upper-case. While the first letter of names of properties shall be lower-case to ease to distinguish feature types and properties. </p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Attributes</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>isAbstract</strong><br />
  A feature type is abstract or concrete. Abstract type can not produce instances. For example, boundaries of cities, land uses, and vegetations are all &quot;boundaries&quot;. However boundary is an abstract concept and you cannot see it. This is the reason we separate types abstract and concrete. Concrete types inherit the properties of their parental concepts. If a feature type is abstract, the value will be &quot;true&quot;, otherwise &quot;false&quot;.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>name</strong><br />
  A name of the feature type.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>definition</strong><br />
  A definition of the feature type. It should be described to explain meaning of this type in the application schema (universe of discource).</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Associations</span></p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>parent</strong><br />
A feature type may derive properties of a parental type as mentioned above. While a parent is derived by children. Such relationship is called inheritance. The association between parent and children is a self association, because it is an association between different feature types. In case of gittok, multiple inheritance is not allowed to keep the structure as simple as possible. According to the notation rule of UML, inheritance relationship is represented as an arrow of which front end is triangle. However, GFM is a meta-schema to show how to represent application schemata. A self-association between feature types shown in GFM specifies that application schema may have inheritance relationship between different feature types.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>children</strong><br />
Feature types inherit properties of a parent type are child types.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>proxyName</strong><br />
The attribute on behalf of the feature is called proxy. ProxyName is a name of the proxy type.  Gittok represents  features on the screen in accordance with the proxy type. For example, when proxy type is CharacterString, you should select the list as the view of features. While, when proxy type is geometry, a map will be the appropriate representation. In gittok, CharacterString and Geometry (SG_Point, SG_Curve and SG_Surface) can be the proxy type. Proxy is useful to connect the from-feature to the to-feature by the association. Thus, proxy instance shall be unique in the kit.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Association</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>parent</strong><br />
Feature type may have parent and child relationship between another feature type. Such a relationship is called inheritance. A child feature type inherit the properties from its parent. For example boundary is a parent type of political boundary and vegetation boundary. political and vegetation boundaries inherit its name, if boundary has a name as the attribute.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>children</strong><br />
Child feature type inherits properties of a parent. A parent may relates to more than one child features. They are called children.The relationship from children to a parent is called generalization. While relationship from parent to children is called specialization. </p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>attributeTypes</strong><br />
Attribute is an inherent characteristic of the feature. For example, name, length, height, color, and so on are all attributes of features. AttributeTypes describes definitions of more than one attribute types. </p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>operationTypes</strong><br />
Operation is an action to produce information from feature attributes as input (or argument) by executing a process when it is required. One feature type may have more than one operation types.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>links</strong><br />
  Links is a roll name of the association type. From-feature links an association instance. From-feature may associates with more than one associaltion types.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>linkedBy</strong><br />
  LinkedBy is a roll name of the association type. A to-feature is linked by an association instance.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">AssociationType</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Association is an equivalent relationship between features. It is a real world phenomenon. Feature type may associates with other types through &quot;links&quot;. For example, a school may link campus, buildings and playing fields through the association. Conceptually &quot;association&quot; itself is a real world phenomenon. It means association is a feature. However, association type in gittok at this time does not inherit Feature Type to avoid the schema will be complex. </p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Attributes</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>name</strong><br />
  a word by which an association type is referred.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>definition</strong><br />
  statement of the exact meaning of the association type.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>roleName</strong><br />
  Role name is an identification of the role of the target feature type that is viewed by a feature type. For example, school building, warehouse, and apartment house may be role names of the feature type &quot;Building&quot;.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>style</strong><br />
  Style indicates the method to associate from-feature with to-features. Usually, to-features are not eliminated even from-feature is eliminated. However, to-features are also eliminated, if association style is &quot;composition&quot;, It is called strong association. At this time, you can select composition, but to-features are not eliminated even if from-feature is eliminated. This is improved in the future. In UML notation rule there is a style called aggregation. Its meaning is &quot;part-of&quot; relationship. Gittok does not implement aggregation because its definition is un-clear from the view point of information processing. In gittok, aggregation is same as usual association.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>multiplicity</strong><br />
  If multiplicity is true, more than one features are associated by a from-feature. If it is false, single to-feature is association by a from-feature.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Associations</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>from</strong><br />
  feature type associating to-features</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>to</strong><br />
  associated feature type</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>attributeTypes</strong><br />
  Inherent characteristics of an association type. For example a distance between two features maybe an attribute of the association. </p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>operationTypes</strong><br />
  Operations of an association type. For example an operation to obtain a distance between two features. A distance in this case is a derived attribute.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">AttributeType</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Attribute type defines a characteristic of a feature or an association. Let’s imagine &quot;red car&quot;. This is an instance of the type &quot;Car&quot; with the attribute type &quot;color&quot;. If color is described by an integer, the data type of color attribute type is &quot;Integer&quot;. In addition, if there is a possibility to use more than one color, the attribute type &quot;color&quot; should be defined as the type with multiplicity. In addition, if the data type of an attribute is number, the unit maybe required. For example, height of the car should have the unit of measure such as centi-meter. Finally, an attribute may be derived as the result of operation. It shall be defined as a derived attribute.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Attributes</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>derived</strong><br />
  An attribute is &quot;derived&quot; if it is a return value of the operation</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>name</strong><br />
  A word by which attribute is known. </p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>dataType</strong><br />
  A type of attribute value.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>multiplicity</strong><br />
  When there is a possiblity to put more than one alternative attribute value, multiplicity is true.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>unit</strong><br />
  The name of an unit of measure. It should be given, but it is not mandatory. Because gittok does not check the unit.<br />
</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Meanwhile, data types in gittok are classified into spatial, temporal, place, and thematic. </p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>Spatial data type</strong>: spatial characteristics (geometry) of a feature. There are point, curve and surface in the 2-dimensional space.  Their data types are SG_Point, SG_Curve and SG_Surface. SG_Point is a position of a feature. SG_Curve is a polyline in other words C0 curve in gittok. SG_Surface is a polygon in gittok.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>Temporal data type</strong>: temporal characteristics (geometry) of a feature. There are instant and period in the 1-dimensional space. Their data types are TG_Instant and TG_Period. At this time gittok does not support temporal data types. </p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>Place data type</strong>: Place is an identifiable part of any space [ISO 19155]. There are many methods of identifications. For example, address, name of landmark, zip-code and geographic coordinates are identifiers of the part of the real world. URI, ISBN and DOI are identifiers in the virtual world. Place identifier referencing the part of real world is called geographic identifier. In case of ISO 19100 family of standards, spatial referencing by coordinates is specified in ISO 19111, and spatial referencing by geographic identifier is specified in ISO 19112. </p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>Thematic data type</strong>: The term &quot;thematic&quot; is defined as &quot;relating to a particular subject&quot;. In gittok, attributes without spatial, temporal and place are all thematic. For example, name, memo, color, weight, width, height, material and so on are thematic attributes.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">These attribute data types are explained in detail at &quot;Attribute Type Designer&quot; page.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">OperationType</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Operation can be seen as an &quot;on demand&quot; attribute. For example, Shortest Path Finding is an operation and it returns the path so as to be a value of an attribute in a feature. Operation relating the earth is frequently called &quot;spatial analysis&quot;. Operation is defined by the name, algorithm or program module, input variable types (argument types) and an output variable type (return value type). Return variable is called derived attribute type in gittok.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">If a program performing an operation has potential used in various applications, it should be provided so as to be shared among applications. In gittok, operations are provided as independent functions. Application schema designer can select them from the repository as operations in feature types. </p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Attributes</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>type</strong><br />
  A name of type (class) which comprises the operation.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>name</strong><br />
  a name of the operation.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>returnFATypeName</strong><br />
  A nameof a feature type or an association type including the attribute type in which the return value is stored.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>returnAttributeName</strong><br />
  The name of an attribute type which value is a result of the operation. The data type of this attribute type shall be same as the return value type of the operation.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>returnAttributeType</strong><br />
An data type of the derived attribute in which the return value is stored.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Gittok gets the definition of the feature type or the association type which includes the derived attribute. The definition can be obtained from the application schema. Gittok stores the return value in the derived attribute which name is the value of returnAttributeName after confirmation of correspondence of the data type. </p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Associations</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>arguments</strong><br />
  combination of input value types and corresponding feature attributes.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="secondHeader">ArgAttPair</span></p>
<p class="mainSentence">ArgAttPair is a combination of a feature attribute type and corresponding argument type of the operation.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Attributes</span></p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>fromTo</strong><br />
  If the value of this attribute is &quot;self&quot;, then the attribute type corresponding to the argument is defined in the  same feature type or association type.<br />
  If the value of this attribute is &quot;from&quot;, then the attribute type corresponding to the argument is defined in  the feature type as from-type of the association.<br />
  f the value of this attribute is &quot;to&quot;, then the attribute type corresponding to the argument is defined in  the feature type as to-type of the association.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>targetType</strong><br />
  feature type including the attribute type corresponding to the argument type.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Associations</span></p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>argumentType</strong><br />
  This is a roll name of AtrributeType working as an argument type. Argument of the operation is defined by name, data type, multiplicity and unit. It is same as attribute type of feature or association.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>attributeType</strong><br />
  This is a roll name of AttributeType working as an attribute type including in the feature or association.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">An attribute corresponding to the argument shall be defined so as to be clear it is a part of from-feature, to-feature, or a feature including this attribute. For example, to get a distance from one building to the river, the operation to obtain distance from surface to curve called getDistanceStoC. could be used. In this case, getDistanceStoC is included in the association from Building to River. The operation and return value &quot;distance&quot; are included in the association. An argument of the surface corresponds with the shape of building, while the curve corresponds with the shape of riverbank. </p>
<p class="mainSentence">The variation of operation provided by gittok and spatial analysis is introduced in Analyst page.</p>

<p class="mainSentence">Figure 3. Main page for application schema definition</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Figure 3 shows the framework of rules for feature type and association type definitions in UML. Feature type may relate with a parent feature type and child feature types. Feature type may links association types and feature type may be linked by association types. Association type connects from-feature type and to-feature type. </p>
<p class="mainSentence">For example, road and building are artifacts. They inherit properties of artifact. Artifact is a parent of road and building. There are many buildings at the road side. Therefore, a road instance associates with multiple building instances by association called RtoB for instance. </p>
