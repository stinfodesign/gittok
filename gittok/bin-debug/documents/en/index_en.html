<p class="secondHeader">Introduction</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Gittok (Geospatial Information Technology Tool Kit) is a software tool for the introductory course on Geospatial Information Technology. It is useful for undergraduate students and beginners of GIT in industory. Gittok is developed by Morishige Ota [Kokusai Kogyo Co., Ltd.], a member of GIT Working Group (Leader: Koichi Kubota [Chuo University]) set under the research project &quot;Geospatial Information Sciences Education and Spatial Thinking (Leader: Yasushi Asami [The University of Tokyo] ), 2009-2013.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">We expect that you will understand fundamental knowledge on GIT by study the instruction now you are reading, and slides provided for the lectures. And you  may use gittok to solve your problems relating GIT in the class room. Furthermore, maybe, you will have a mind to develop your own Geographic Information System after studying GIT with gittok.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">However, you need to know what is Geospatial Information Technology (GIT) before studying this field. It is the information technology regarding geospatial information. Geospatial information is an object with position and shape on Earth. There are various  natural and artificial phenomena occur and cease to exist on Earth in every moment. For example, earthquake and typhoon are phenomena happen frequently in Japan, and they sometimes give serious effects to our life. Social problems such as population increasing and decreasing, environment change also effect our quality of life. Most of these problems relates to 5W1H (where, when, why, who, what, and how). GIT is an information technology especially emphasizing where and when. Meanwhile, Information Technology is a technology that conceptualize, acquire, manage, analyze, exchange, and represent information. Consequently, GIT is a technology that conceptualize, acquire, manage, exchange and represent information with position and shape on Earth.</p>
