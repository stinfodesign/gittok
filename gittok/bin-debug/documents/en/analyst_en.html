<p class="FirstHeader">Analyst<br/>
</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Analyst enables to execute operations included in feature or association. Operation is a method or function to return data as a result of processing by receiving arguments as input data. In the context of geospatial information sciences, operations using position on the earth is called spatial analysis. This is the reason that the name of this page is Analyst.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">This text explains the procedure of the execution of an operation, fields and buttons in Analyst page, the mechanism of operation, and how to buid in operations in gittok.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">Operation procedure</p>
<p class="mainSentence">1. Base map and geometries appear in Instance view panel by opening a kit file.<br />
  2. &quot;Feature&quot; or &quot;Association&quot; tab is selected in order to execute operations.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">In case of Feature</p>
<p class="mainSentence">1. Radio button of geometry type that is a proxy of the feature is selected by selecting feature type at Feature type list.<br />
  2. Instance id is shown in Instance ID field by selecting feature instance on Instance view panel. Simultaneously, a name and return data type of the operation are displayed on Operation grid.<br />
  3. Operation is executed by clicking &quot;execute&quot; button after the selection of operation at Operation grid.<br />
  4. The result of operation is displayed in Return attribute value field. If the return data type is simple, the value is shown in the value field. While if it is complex, an id of the return value is shown in the id field.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">In case of Association</p>
<p class="mainSentence">1. The names of feature types are displayed in From and To fields and the list of operations are shown in Operation grid by selecting association type at Association type list.<br />
  2. Association instance is selected at Association instance ID list.<br />
  3. Instance ids are displayed in From and To boxes.<br />
  4. If it is necessary to confirm the selection, click show button. Then blue triangles (From) and red triangles (to) are displayed in the panel.<br />
  5. Click &quot;execute&quot; button to execute the operation.<br />
