<p class="mainSentence">Eitor page allows the acquisition of geospatial data as instances of feature or association types in accordance with the application schema that you designed. You can save geospatial dataset called &quot;kit&quot; as a result of acquisition. This section explains instance model that is a rule how to describe a kit as a set of instances. Then,  the procedure of data acquisition is introduced. Finally, how to use Editor page is explained.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">Instance Model</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">What is instance model?</span><br />
Instance is an object acquired in accordance with the application schema.  Geospatial dataset is a set of instances and related information. It is called &quot;kit&quot; in gittok.General Feature model specifies how to describe an application schema. Apprication schema specifies how to describe feature and association instances.  Instance model specifies the structure of the kit. </p>

<p class="mainSentence"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Instance Model and kit</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Instance model is defined as the UML class diagram shown below (See Figure 2). Instance model is a general-purpose schema for the implementation of geospatial data in accordance with an application schema. Types and associations in the instance model are explained below.</p>

<p class="secondHeader">Kit</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Introduction</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Kit is a geospatial dataset which includes a set of instances and related information. Kit is constructed in compliance with the application schema. A kit includes a set of feature instances (FeatureSet) following one feature type and a set of association instances (AssociationSet) following one association type. Usually application schema may includes more than one feature types and more than one association types. An array of feature sets is called featureSetArray, and an array of association sets is called associationSetArray. Both arrays are parts of a kit. For example, if an application schema includes feature types such as Building, Road and Bridge, and association types such as BuildingToRoad and RoadToBridge, then there are three feature sets included in the feature set array and two association sets included in the association set array.  In Instance Model, Kit associates with featureSetArray: an array of FeatureSet, and Kit associates with assciationSetArray: an array of AssociationSet (Figure 2).</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">attributes</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>applicationSchemaURL</strong><br />
  Kit has URL of application schema to show where it is stored.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>baseMapImageURL</strong><br />
  Gittok uses a base map image to digitize geometries and attributes. This URL is the location of the base map.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>affineParam</strong><br />
  Geometric attributes are digitized on the map displayed on the screen. Therefore, the transformation between map coordinates and plane rectangular coordinates on the ground is required.  Gittok uses affine transformation for this purpose. AffineParam includes parameters and accuracyinformation for the transformation. The text in CRS Editor will explain about coordinate transformation in detail.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>crsURL</strong><br />
  The coordinate reference system is required for the conversion between plane coordinates and geodetical coordinates (latitude and longitude).

<p class="secondHeader">Data acquisition</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">What is data acquisition?</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Data acquisition in gittok is to create geospatial data set called &quot;kit&quot;. Kit includes a set of feature and association instances and related information. <br />
  For example, Imagine a feature type &quot;Building&quot; has name, ownership, intended use, address and shape as its attributes. Name and address can be obtained  by field survey. Ownership and intended use may be known by asking appropriate section in the local government, if the data is created for official public purpose. Shape can be obtained by map digitizing or by photogrammetry. These data are integrated to feature instances and association instances. All these activities are called data acquisition.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Possible data acquisition in gittok</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Data is acquired by using the following pages in gittok.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>Editor</strong><br />
  Main page for data acquisition. It is used to edit, store, update and delete features and associations.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>Geometry</strong><br />

  Page to add, edit, update and delete postal address as attributes of a feature.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Acquisition of feature instances</span><br />
</p>
<p class="mainSentence">The following procedure is the acquisition of complex attributes. The acquisition of simple attributes is explained at the next section.<br />
  1. Open Editor page by clicking acquisition icon on the title page of gittok.<br />
  2. Open an application schema created at Modeler page.<br />
  3. Select a feature type from FeatureType drop down list after clicking Feature tab. By selection, the list of attribute name, data type and multiplicity of feature attributes is displayed in Attribute Type List.<br />
  4. Add the empty feature instance by clicking add button located near at the label &quot;Instance ID&quot;. New instance id is shown on the drop down list &quot;Instance ID&quot;.<br />
  5. Open an attribute editing page for appropriate data type by clicking the attribute type listed on Attribute Type List. <br />
6. Acquire, digitize and edit attributes on the page. </p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Acquisition of feature attributes</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>Attributes of simple data type</strong><br />
  1. Key in an attribute value in &quot;Value&quot; text input box.<br />
  2. The attribute value is displayed in &quot;value&quot; field in Value Grid.<br />
  3. If multiplicity is true, repeat 1 and 2 until all values are added.<br />
  Click delete button after the selection of appropriate value, if it is un-necessary.</p>
<p class="mainSentence"><strong>Attributes of complex data type</strong><br />
  1. Add attribute values on the editing page such as Spatial, Place, Address and Memo.<br />
  2. Select appropriate attribute value on the editing page.<br />
  3. The attribute id is displayed in &quot;id&quot; field in Value Grid by clicking add button located at lower right of Editor page.<br />
  4. If multiplicity is true, repeat 2 and 3 until all values are added.<br />
  Click delete button after the selection of appropriate id, if it is un-necessary. Remember the attribute value on the editing page is not deleted. If it is not needed, Attribute value shall be deleted on the editing page.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Acquisition of association instances</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Association instances are acquired after the acquisition of feature instances. The procedure of the acquisition of association instances is as follows.<br />
  1. Open Editor page by clicking acquisition icon on the title page of gittok.<br />
  2. Open the kit that is already the feature instances are stored.<br />
  3. Select the association type from AssociationType dropdown list after clicking Association tab. Then association from which feature type to which feature type is shown on the panel of connector tab.<br />
  4. Add new association instance by clicking &quot;add&quot; button.<br />
  5. Open proxy attribute editing page by clicking &quot;from&quot; radio button. For example, if the proxy of the from-feature type is geometry, then Geometry page appears.<br />
  6. Select all features by clicking proxy attributes on the attribute editing page. Instance ids are displayed respectively at Instance ID list on Editor page.<br />
  7. Open proxy attribute editing page by clicking &quot;to&quot; radio button. Then select all features by clicking proxy attributes on the attribute editing page.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Association between &quot;from&quot; to &quot;to&quot; features are confirmed by clicking &quot;show&quot; button on Editor page. For example, Blue and red triangles are shown on Geometry page. Blue means &quot;from&quot;, while red means &quot;to&quot;. After clicking &quot;show&quot; button, the label changes to &quot;clear&quot;. And triangles are eliminated by clicking&quot;clear&quot; button.  &quot;Clear&quot; is replaced be &quot;show&quot; again. If the proxy of from or to features is character string, then List page appears to show the proxy of feature.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Acquisiton of association attributes</p>
<p class="mainSentence">As long as association is a phenomenon in the real world, association is a feature. However in gittok, association is independent from feature. Association has attributes and operations but it does not have inheritance relationship to make the structure of application schema simple. The following procedure is the association attribute acquisition.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">1. The list of attribute types is shown by selecting &quot;attributeEditor&quot; tab. <br />
  2. Select appropriate attribute in the list.<br />
  3. Get attribute values as same as the procedure of feature attribute acquisition.</p>
<p class="thirdHeader">Save and open of  kit files</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Feature and association instances are disappeared after closing gittok. Kit should be saved to avoid such a situation. Kit is stored in the computer by clicking &quot;save&quot; button in Editor page. Save a file after input or selecting the folder and the name of the kit.<br />
Input a kit file in gittok by clicking &quot;open&quot; button in Editor page. The name of the kit is shown in the label under &quot;open &quot; and &quot;save&quot; button. </p>
<p class="mainSentence"><span class="thirdHeader">Merge</span><br />
</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Kit file can be merged when more than one people collaborate for data acquisition. But gittok does not check the duplicate input of instances today. Therefore be careful so as not to happen the duplication. Kit file is merged by clicking &quot;merge&quot; button and selecting the kit for merge.</p>
<p class="secondHeader">Parameters of Coordinate Reference System</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Coordinates included in spatial attribute is map coordinates digitized on Geometry page. These coordinates are converted to ground coordinates (plane rectangular coordinates) by Affine transformation. Then, conversion between ground coordinates and geodetic coordinates (longitude, latiiude) is performed by Gauss-Kruger projection. To execute this conversion, geodetic datum and the definition of coordinate system are required. Gittok prepares CRS (Coordinate Reference System) editor in Editor page. Click edit CRS button to open CRS editor and read the tutorial written about CRS in detail.</p>
