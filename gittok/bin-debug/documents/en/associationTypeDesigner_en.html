<p class="secondHeader">Introduction</p>
<p class="mainSentence">There are various kinds of relationships between features. For example, geometric and topological relationships such as disjoint and inclusion, and temporal relationship such as before and after. They are relationships between attributes of features. Parent and child relationship is the conceptual relationship between more abstract feature and more concrete features. For example,  'vegetation area' is a special 'area' on the ground. An area may have a properties  such as an extent and a vegetation area has an extent and its inherent properties such as classification of vegetation. It means the child feature inherits properties of the parent feature. </p>
<p class="mainSentence">Association Type Designer is used to design relationships without inheritance. Inheritance is defined in Feature Type Designer.. Relationships without inheritance is called association. According to gittok GFM, association is the relationship between a from-feature to a to-feature. A from-feature links a to-feature through association, while a to-feature is linked bya from-feature through association. For example, School links Building through an association called for example BelongingBuildings. The roll of such a building is a 'school building'.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">Association is similar to feature. It is also abstraction of real world phenomena. It may have attributes and operations. However in gittok, association cannot have inheritance relationship to keep its structure simple. </p>
<p class="mainSentence">There is an unique association called composition. Under composition, to-features are erased simultaneously when the from-feature is eliminated. For example, rooms disappear simultaneously when the building is destroyed. A to-feature by the composition shall not be a to-feature of other from-feature. Because, it will be difficult to erase the to-feature.</p>
<p class="mainSentence">In the text of UML, one can find association called an aggregation. However in gittok, we assume aggregation is same as usual association, because there is no big difference from the view point of data implementation.</p>
